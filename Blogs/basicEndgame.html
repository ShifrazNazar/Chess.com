          <h2>Rule #1 - Master the Basic Checkmates!</h2>
          <p>
            There isn't really much to say here. Your ability to win a chess
            game is based on whether or not you can checkmate the enemy King.
            But more importantly, and as will be reviewed in Rule #5, you can't
            truly make accurate decisions in the more complex situations of a
            game unless you are confident in your ability to deliver a full
            point when it matters most. The basic checkmates that must be
            mastered are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span>King and Queen vs King</span> -> Because every King and Pawn
              Ending ends with the promotion of a pawn. If you can't checkmate
              with a Queen, then you can't truly master King and Pawn Endings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Two Rooks (or the Rook Roller) vs King</span> -> Because
              it's lots of fun!
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>King and Rook vs King </span> -> Because many Rook and Pawn
              endings (arguably the most commonly reached practical ending) end
              with one side having to give up their Rook for a Pawn. If you
              can't do this mate, then you can't win Rook and Pawn endings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>King and Two Bishops vs King </span> -> Because two Bishops
              are better than one!
            </li>
            <li>
              And only once you've reached a higher level (I would say 1800
              Rated) -> <span>ing and Knight & Bishop vs King</span> - When
              you're ready!
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>
            Rule #2 - Win, When, Winning -- Master the Basics of Technique!
          </h2>
          <p>
            This rule is not just another way to remind you to checkmate when
            you are ahead large amounts of material. It is more of a "state of
            mind" or general approach than it is a specific pattern. Basically,
            the principles of winning won positions (and yes, that makes sense
            grammatically ðŸ˜Ž) can be broken down into a system:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span>Keep It "Simple"/Simplify</span> -- Basically, if either
              side possesses more than a full piece (minor) advantage (and in
              some cases, a clear two pawn advantage is good enough) they should
              be looking for every opportunity to trade piece. Simplify the
              position down to its "purest" form (kind of like doing "fractions"
              in math). This is a principle of technique that applies in both
              Middlegames and Endgames, but you would be surprised if I told you
              how often I see amateur games get "blown" simply because whoever
              was winning dismissed their opportunities to trade pieces, and
              instead played for some kind of crazy checkmate attack ðŸ˜«... You
              aren't being "wimpy" by taking the life out of a position where
              you have already earned a large advantage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Keep an "Eye Out"</span> -- If/when you've achieved a
              significant advantage, your opponent's threats just became more
              important than your own brilliant plans! I know that's hard to
              take in, but the point is that "tricks" are all your opponent has
              left. Chess is much more a science than it is an art (just let
              that sink in for a moment ðŸ˜­). The "bad news" is that that means
              chess at the highest level isn't as fun as it looks and that there
              isn't nearly as much creative thinking required to become a great
              chess player as you think there is... The "good news" is that,
              technically, if you have a clear advantage and play perfectly from
              then on out, it wouldn't matter if your opponent got up and Garry
              Kasparov sat down -- if your position is winning, you should win
              it! It's that simple. So, if you can have a "defensive" eye and
              not get careless about your opponent's tricks, you will convert
              all your endgame advantages into a full point!
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Keep Playing Chess</span> -- The game isn't over, despite
              your advantage. So, pay attention to all the other principles in
              this article and remember that if there isn't a clear "path to
              victory" by trading pieces, you have to keep playing good moves!
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
          <h2>Rule #3 - Passed Pawns MUST be Pushed!</h2>
          <p>
            Push your passed pawns if you got 'em (yeah, that's it)! Recognize a
            passed pawn, and push it! Whether it be a basic Endgame simply
            begging for one side to march their pawn up the board and promote,
            or even a more complex position with plenty to think about besides
            the pawns -- you must push your passed pawns! So, we figured it
            would be a crime not to remind you of that!
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a cool position where the "passer" was the key to victory:

          <h2>Rule #4 - Activate Your King!</h2>
          <div class="content flex">
            <div class="text">
              <p>
                One thing that really separates the final stage of chess from
                the rest of the game is King play! Every great endgame player in
                history not only understood the importance of King activation,
                but they anticipated precisely when the middlegame was ending,
                and that it was time to bring out the big guy!
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally, as soon as the Queen's have been traded you should
                consider the possibility of bringing out your King. In cases
                where there still exists lots of enemy forces (particularly the
                two Rooks and at least two minor pieces) -- you might want to
                put the reigns on your leader, but don't lose a game because you
                brought your King into the battle too late! Here is a great
                example from a game of my own. Though it's complex, try to
                anticipate how the King might "find his way" to help the Rook on
                h8 promote the h7-pawn:

            <div class="text"> -->
          <p>
            This is one of my favorite "concepts" or "mind-sets" to teach
            beginners, as I believe it can change their entire approach to the
            game when they "get it". You must recognize your goal or long term
            strength/opponent's weakness to attack before you can ever expect to
            make an accurate decision with what's in front of you. Basically,
            most players drastically (to the point of "tragic comedy") misplay
            endings because they never take 5 minutes to stop, make some mental
            notes about all the long term weaknesses and strengths of their
            position, before they start making moves. Rather, they assume that
            with fewer pieces on the board there is less to think about, and
            they play as such... BIG MISTAKE ðŸ˜­
          </p>
          <p>
            GM Khachiayn talks about it in his videos as "thinking from the end"
            -- which is a different way to say the same thing. Stop and make a
            commitment to a plan or long term goal, and watch all of your
            calculations get better! Players critique themselves for making
            blunders and miscalculating simple things, but without a goal in
            mind, it is hard to keep yourself "on track" -- so of course you are
            going to make mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Russian/Soviet School of Chess takes this approach a step
            further by teaching all their students endgames first. Kind of like
            my recommendation to master the basic checkmate patterns BEFORE
            anything else. Knowing what's next makes all of your decisions
            better. It isn't that GMs are calculating 50 moves ahead, they just
            know more endings then you do -- so not only are their decisions in
            the endgame better, but you almost never reach a relatively equal
            one with a stronger player because they were making better
            Middlegame moves based on their knowledge of the ensuing ending.
            Make sense? Man, that was tough to say ðŸ˜¬... Glad I got that out
            ðŸ˜‰...

                Zugzwang and Zwischenzug. If you don't know what those words
                mean, check this out. I included both "famous-German-Chess"
                words here because, well, I can -- but really, Zugzwang is the
                "beast of the endgame". Do you realize how many endgames would
                otherwise be a draw if it weren't for Zugzwang? If you (or your
                opponent) didn't have to move unless they "felt like it" the
                chess world would be a much more peaceful place ðŸ˜‰. Dozens, if
                not hundreds, of King and Pawn Endings rely on Zugzwang to be
                successful, several critical Rook Endings, and countless other
                positions. Here is a few (including our 2nd example from the

              <p>
                This rule is more of a concept or idea that has become a staple
                part of every good coach's "endgame teaching repertoire".
                Basically, teaching their students that against tough defense --
                even a clear advantage like an extra pawn may not be enough.
                Many Rook endings are drawn after all, and minor piece endings
                always have the potential that a player might sacrifice and
                leave you with an extra piece but no winning chances.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, rather than beating your head against the "proverbial wall"
                with one advantage, let your advantage serve as a clamp on your
                opponent's ability to defend a different target. By creating a
                second weakness you often increase the strength of your first
                advantage.
              </p>
              <p>
                A very simple example of this idea, and one that I used in my
                video series on the subject is:

          <h2>Rule #9 - Be Concrete & Calculate!</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike any other "phase" to chess, the endgame requires more
            knowledge of specific positions and patterns. What if you realized
            that in the majority of the endgames you play, the result is likely
            already decided or forced if the best moves are played by both
            sides? That's kind of scary when you think about it, right ðŸ¤”? It
            means that being general and/or trying to evaluate things
            intuitively is very risky.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a beginner, you can't expect yourself to have the knowledge of
            technical positions that a master level (let alone a Grandmaster)
            player would have. BUT what you can do is take my piece of advice as
            something similar to the "never turn your back on the ocean" saying,
            ie -- approach the endgame like every move could be your last!!! Be
            concrete, calculate, "don't move until you see it", etc... If you
            play chess with a healthy fear of endings and that they are actually
            the hardest stage of the game where there is the most to calculate,
            then you will be on the right track already.

        <div class="rule">
          <h2>Rule #10 - Fewer Pieces = Less Room for Error!</h2>
          <p>
            Similar to our last rule, this principle is in place to remind you
            of the scary fact that endgames require the most precision of any
            stage of the game. Unless you are simply lost and only postponing
            things to avoid going home, or totally winning and enjoying the
            torture of your helpless opponent -- then you are by definition
            involved in a relatively equal ending that requires, here it comes,
            your complete focus and hard work!
