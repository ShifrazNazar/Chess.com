        <h1>1. Magnus Carlsen</h1>
        <h2>
          Carlsen’s understanding of the game far exceeds anyone in chess
          history.
        </h2>
        <img src="../Assests/magnus.jpg" alt="magnus" />
        <p>
          That could be because he is the only player on this list currently
          active, or it could be due to his understanding and experience at such
          a young age. At just 19 years old, Magnus Carlsen became the youngest
          player to ever become number one in terms of rating. Then, from 2018
          to 2020, Carlsen had the longest undefeated streak in chess, where he
          didn’t lose for 125 games. This, along with his several World
          Championships over the last several years, has ingrained him as a top
          player in chess history.

        <h1>2. Garry Kasparov</h1>
        <h2>
          Kasparov has been a crucial voice in chess since coming onto the
          scene.
        </h2>
        <img src="../Assests/Garry Kasparov.jpg" alt="Garry Kasparov" />
        <p>
          While he originally represented Russia, he has since come out against
          their dictatorship and he doesn’t want to be associated with them.
          During his time as a chess player, Kasparov was known for his ability
          to calculate a position far beyond his peers. At just 22 years, he
          captured the World Chess Championship, becoming the youngest person
          ever to do so.

        <h1>3. Bobby Fischer</h1>
        <h2>Fischer changed the way we think of chess- and how we play it!</h2>
        <img src="../Assests/bobby-fischer.jpg" alt="bobby fischer" />

        <p>
          During the Cold War with Russia, there was also a political war
          happening in chess. During a time when Spassky and other Russian Super
          GMs easily controlled the chess game, Fischer was able to break
          through and give Americans a player to root for. While he never held
          the World Championship title as long as the other players on this
          list, Fischer still dominated when he was at the top of his game. In
          1963/64, during the US Chess Championship, Fischer became the only
          player to achieve a perfect score and win, as he had six years prior.

        <h1>4. Alexander Alekhine</h1>
        <h2>
          Alekhine was a Russian Grandmaster during the early 1900s, whose
          influence still persists today.
        </h2>
        <img src="../Assests/Alexander Alekhine.jpeg" alt="Alexander Alekhine" />

        <p>
          While he was an incredible chess player who held the title for an
          astounding 17 years, what set Alekhine apart from other chess players
          was his aptitude for theory. Alekhine wrote over 20 chess books during
          his career and he has several openings named after him.Although today
          we think of Alekhine for his positional awareness and his opening
          prowess, his attacking ability was renowned at the time. Like other
          generational talents of chess, his ability to calculate far exceeded
          those of his peers and it led to a career full of victories and theory
          that lasted for decades.

      <section>
        <h1>5. Paul Morphy</h1>
        <h2>
          Morphy comes from a different era in chess when the game was more
          artistic than scientific.
        </h2>
        <img src="../Assests/Paul Morphy.jpg" alt="Paul Morphy" />

        <p>
          Some people don’t feel Morphy belongs among the top players, because
          when we analyse his games today, he often didn’t find the best moves.
          But when he was playing in the 1850s, chess wasn’t the serious game it
          was today. Rather, it was seen as a way for smart people to express
          themselves artistically. The Greatest Chess Players to Ever Play the
          Game Throughout chess history, there have been some incredible players
          that have dominated their era so much that their greatness cannot be
          denied! Chess great Magnus Carlsen From holding onto the World
          Champion title for an absurd amount of time to sweeping tournaments
          with the strongest GMs in the world to winning equal positions over
          and over again, find out about the greatest chess players of all time.
          5. Morphy was one of the best at playing an artistic game. His Opera
          Game, arguably the most popular chess game of all time, is a pure
          beauty- and its fame proves that. Morphy finds an incredible (yet
          simple) queen sacrifice to win the game.
